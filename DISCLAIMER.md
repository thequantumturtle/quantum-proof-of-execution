This project is experimental. It is not a consensus protocol, not a security primitive, and does not claim quantum advantage.

Do not treat this repository as a production-ready system or a source of cryptographic security guarantees. It is a toy exploration of interfaces between quantum SDKs, record formats, and blockchain anchoring.
